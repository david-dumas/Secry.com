    description: 'Anonymously ask people you know what they think. Create a group with classmates, colleagues or friends. You’ll know exactly who is in a group, but when chatting or sending a survey you won’t know who sent a message or survey response. Zero shame, more awareness, and deeper connections.',

    heartOne: 'Deeper connections with people from real life, people from school or work you already know.',
    heartTwo: 'Zero shame, zero judgement. Because Secry is anonymous, people can say what they really think.',
    heartThree: 'Unlike the ‘perfect’ social media world, where images are edited, only the best image is chosen and where everyone seems to live a ‘perfect’ life. Secry is about the real world, where people get to know the real person behind the edited images and so-called ‘perfect’ lifes.',
    heartFour: 'Awareness, understanding and deeper connections.'
